When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository can be used after the completion of a module or to push a logical change.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To have better track of changes made self and pull the remote changes to local once the collaborated changes are looked to have better clarity.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks is to get a users repository to our own in github and the fork activity is saved at the project owner, the forked repository has the reference pointing to actual owner's repository.
	
	Clone is to get the owned public repository to the any user's local machine.
	
	Branch is a new commit from which a new set/sequence of commits are made and later can be merged into the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Which helps in resolving the merge conflict.
